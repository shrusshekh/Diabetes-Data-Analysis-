## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

1. Read diabetes data from a CSV file (statscan_diabetes.csv)

2. Compute key statistics:
- Average blood glucose levels
- Average BMI
- Average BMI per age group

3. Display the results clearly in the terminal

4. Visualize the data using GNUPlot, showing:
- BMI vs. Blood Glucose Level
- Age vs. BMI
